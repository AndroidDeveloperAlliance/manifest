Android Developer Alliance
===========
To get started with Android Developer Alliance Roms, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/version-control.html).

Register an account on our Gerrit
---------------
First you need to generate an sshkey

At a terminal window type

    ssh-keygen

then hit enter through the prompts...

browse to ~/.ssh by running:

    cd ~/.ssh
    
and copy your sshkey with:

    cat id_rsa.pub
    
copy what is shown to your clipboard

Go to our [Gerrit Review Site](http://review.androiddeveloperalliance.org)

Upper right hand corner hit 'register'
Select with google/yahoo account and signin
Select a Name
Select a username <!write this down!> a.k.a <gerrit.username>
Paste the ssh key you got from the last step of 'Generate a sshkey'
Your Done!!

Initializing a Build Environment
--------------------------

Installing the JDK
The Sun JDK is no longer in Ubuntu's main package repository. In order to download it, you need to add the appropriate repository and indicate to the system which JDK should be used.


Installing Java 6/7 jre and jdk using oad-java.sh

How do I download and run this thing?
-------------------------------------
Like this.
::

  cd ~/
  wget https://github.com/flexiondotorg/oab-java6/raw/0.2.6/oab-java.sh -O oab-java.sh
  chmod +x oab-java.sh
To install the Java 6 jre/jdk
  sudo ./oab-java.sh
To install the Java 7 jre/jdk
  sudo ./oab-java.sh -7

If you are behind a proxy you may need to run using:
::

 sudo ./oab-java.sh
or
 sudo ./oab-java.sh -7

If you want to see what this script is doing while it is running then execute
the following from another shell:
::

  tail -f ./oab-java.sh.log

How it works
------------
This script is merely a wrapper for the most excellent Debian packaging
scripts prepared by Janusz Dziemidowicz.

* https://github.com/rraptorr/sun-java6
* https://github.com/rraptorr/oracle-java7

sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

Or if you ran the script with the -7 option.
::

  sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jre
  sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-jdk

If you already have the *"official"* Ubuntu packages installed then you
can upgrade by executing the following from a shell.
::

  sudo apt-get upgrade


    
    
Installing required packages

64-bit (recommended)


    sudo apt-get install git-core gnupg flex bison gperf build-essential \
    zip curl zlib1g-dev libc6-dev lib32ncurses5-dev ia32-libs \
    x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32readline-gplv2-dev lib32z-dev \
    libgl1-mesa-dev g++-multilib mingw32 tofrodos python-markdown \
    libxml2-utils xsltproc
    
    
On Ubuntu 10.10:


    sudo ln -s /usr/lib32/mesa/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib32/mesa/libGL.so
    
On Ubuntu 11.10:


    sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so.6 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libX11.so

Create the Directories
----------------------

You will need to set up some directories in your build environment.

To create them run:

    mkdir -p ~/bin 

    mkdir -p ~/ada


Install the Repository
----------------------

Enter the following to download make executable the "repo" binary:


curl https://dl-ssl.google.com/dl/googlesource/git-repo/repo > ~/bin/repo

chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Now open up your bashrc (nano ~/.bashrc) and add the following to the end:

PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Save the file and source it:

source ~/.bashrc

cd ~/bin

repo init

You may need to reboot for these changes to take effect. 


Now enter the following to initialize the repository:

    cd ~/ada

Repositories:
---------------

Before you continue --> run this in the terminal

	git config --global review.review.androiddeveloperalliance.org.username <gerrit username>

    repo init -u git://github.com/AndroidDeveloperAlliance/manifest.git -b jb

    repo sync


Building the System
---------------

The basic sequence of build commands is as follows:
Initialize
Initialize the environment with the envsetup.sh script. Note that replacing "source" with a single dot saves a few characters, and the short form is more commonly used in documentation.


    . build/envsetup.sh
    lunch

Enter the number of the build you want to start and press enter



Build the Code:


    make ada


Submitting Patches
------------------
Patches are always welcome!  Please submit your patches via AndroidDeveloperAlliance Gerrit!
You can do this by using these commands:

    (From root android directory)
    . build/envsetup.sh
    (Go to the repo you are patching, make your changes and commit) and use
    repo upload .
    to upload your patches


Make your changes and commit with a detailed message, starting with what you are working with (i.e. vision: Update Kernel)
Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commit using this command: git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>

To view the status of your and others' patches, visit [AndroidDeveloperAlliance Code Review](http://review.androiddeveloperalliance.org/)
